"""Tests for the changelog classifier.

Run: python3 .github/scripts/release-notes_test.py

No network and no token: everything here is the pure decision-making — which
section a pull request lands in, which paths count as shipped, how the footer
accounts for what was left out. The API plumbing around it is exercised by
actually cutting a release, and mocking it would only test the mock.

Every case named with a `#number` is a real pull request from the range this
script was rewritten over, and the expectation is what a reader of the notes
should have seen rather than what they did see.

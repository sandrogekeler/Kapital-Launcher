"""Build the changelog body for a release — the nightly `snapshot` prerelease
and tagged releases alike.

GitHub's own `releases/generate-notes` cannot do the things a shipped build's
changelog needs:

  * It has no notion of *what* a pull request touched, so the website — which
    lives in this repo but ships to Cloudflare Pages, not into the binary —
    fills the notes of a build that does not contain a line of it.
  * It sorts purely by label, so an unlabelled pull request can only land in the
    catch-all, which is where nearly every one of them ended up.

So this script does the same job with the changed-path filter and the
categorisation rules a shipped build actually wants. Both workflows call it, so
a snapshot and the release it is ahead of describe themselves the same way.

What a reader of these notes is owed
------------------------------------

The notes describe *the binary they are about to download*. Everything here
follows from that:

  * Work that ships nowhere near the binary is not in the notes at all. The
    paths that mean this are per-repo facts and live in .github/changelog.json,
    not in this file.
  * A `type:` label decides the section. A title is prose written for a
    reviewer; a label is a deliberate statement about what the change is, and
    CI's `pr-labelled` job is what makes it a reliable one.
  * The title is never read. Guessing from the leading verb once promoted "Add
    a Full release roadmap section and a nightly snapshot build channel" — a
    website and CI change — into the section users read first, so the guess was
    narrowed to the sections where being wrong is cheap, and has now been
    removed outright. A verb is not a statement about what a change *is*:
    plenty of repairs open with "Add" or "Write", and #97 "Write a log file a
    bug reporter can attach" was a fix filed as a feature by a human reading it
    the same way. An unlabelled pull request lands in "Other changes" rather
    than being categorised from prose. Which label to apply is the author's
    decision, and the ladder for making it belongs next to them, in the
    product's CONTRIBUTING.md and pull request template.
  * Maintenance and documentation are counted, not listed. `type:chore` and
    `type:docs` are real work that changed nothing a user can observe; the
    footer says how many there were and the full-changelog link has them all.

Reads:

  GH_TOKEN   a token that can read this repository (required)
  REPO       owner/name (required)
  HEAD_REF   the commit or tag being described (required)
  BASE_TAG   what to measure from. Defaults to the latest published release,
             which is the right answer for both callers: that endpoint skips
             prereleases, so `snapshot` can never become its own baseline, and
             a tagged release's own entry does not exist yet when it runs.
  SERVER     github.com base URL, for the compare link
  CONFIG     path to the per-repo config. Defaults to .github/changelog.json
             next to this script.

Writes the markdown body to stdout. Exits non-zero on any failure, including
having no baseline to measure from — each caller has a fallback, so losing the
notes never costs the build.
